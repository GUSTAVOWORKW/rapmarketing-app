The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error message "TS2304: Cannot find name 'useMemo'." This error indicates a TypeScript error where the name 'useMemo' is not recognized.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the 'useMemo' function is imported from the correct package in your TypeScript files. Verify that the proper import statement is included at the top of your file where 'useMemo' is used.

If 'useMemo' is a React hook, you should import it from 'react' like this:
```javascript
import { useMemo } from 'react';
```

After making the necessary changes, commit the updated code to your repository and trigger a new build to verify if the issue is resolved.
