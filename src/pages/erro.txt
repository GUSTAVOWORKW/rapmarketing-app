Diagnosis: The build failure occurred due to a SyntaxError in the file src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.js. The error specifically states "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for <section>" at line 72.

Solution: To resolve this issue, the developer needs to ensure that the JSX tags in the DashboardLayout.js file are properly closed. The error points to a missing closing tag corresponding to the opening <section> tag. The developer should review the file DashboardLayout.js and add the necessary closing tag to match the opening <section> tag at line 72. They need to verify that all JSX tags are correctly opened and closed throughout the file.
